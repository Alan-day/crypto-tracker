# Post Course â€“ React Project

### Overview

Using your knowledge of the React component lifecycle and JavaScript, we would like you to build an application that allows users to track the price over time of the favourite companies.

- The application should be modelled round the following [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MmrSbqBgcgy30BCO3Ii2xj/Stock-App).
- The API for your stock page is https://www.alphavantage.co.
- The API for your crypto page should be researched and found by you.

### Goals

- **Tested Application: Any components you create should be tested, including mocking any API calls that are made!**
- A Deployed Application: The application should be deployed to firebase (or similar), and in doing this you will need to ensure your API keys are HIDDEN!

### Specifications

There should be 2 pages available to the user, using routing the user should be able to go between a crypto page and a stocks page. Both will look the same (i.e. can you reuse the same component?), and behave the same where a user can type in the ticker of their company/crypto and see a graphical representation of its price over time, as well as the high/low price for the previous day etc.
